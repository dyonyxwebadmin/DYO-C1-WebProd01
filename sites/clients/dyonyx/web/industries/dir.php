              <p>
                When a DIR Customer identifies a need for deliverables-based services within one of the technology categories the following process takes place: 
              </p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Customer drafts an initial Statement of Work (SOW) that may be sent to one or more Vendors for that category. Each SOW, which should be unique and distinct for each project, must describe the deliverables, the acceptance criteria and the service levels. For further clarification of the kind of the minimum requirements expected when describing deliverables, acceptance criteria and service levels, download the sample SOW template [PDF, 55KB].</li>
                <li>The selected Vendor and Customer then work together to complete the SOW and negotiate pricing in accordance with the SOW. Customer also has the discretion to evaluate responses from other Vendors during this process.</li>
                <li>Once both sides negotiate and agree, project requirements and pricing are memorialized by a final SOW that is signed by the authorized representative of both parties. The value of any one SOW may not exceed $10 million, including all renewals, extensions and change orders.</li>
                <li>Customer issues a purchase order (PO) based on the negotiated specifications in accordance with the SOW, and Vendor begins work upon receipt of PO. Vendor then invoices Customer.</li>
              </ol>

              <strong>SOW Submission</strong>

              <p>
                SOWs can be sent in a variety of ways: via email, fax or regular mail. Standard Terms and Conditions.
