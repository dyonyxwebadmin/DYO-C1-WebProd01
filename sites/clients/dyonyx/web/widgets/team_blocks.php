                    <p>Chris Davis was born in 1975 to a poor family in a singlewide trailer. After a rough and tumble upbringing, in which he fought the stereotypical battles of being a redneck, poor trailer trash kid he decided he did not like working in the heat and sweating for a living so he went to tech school.  Just before graduating tech school in 1996, he landed his first real job in a call center with air conditioning, answering phones for other trailer trash who bought Gateway home computer systems and didnâ€™t realize that without dedicated phone service (no party lines) they couldnâ€™t get the modem to work and connect to the internet.  After years of working hard and moving through several companies, leaving the trailer park, getting married and purchasing a real home in a subdivision, he landed at DYONYX where he has been since August of 2006.</p>
